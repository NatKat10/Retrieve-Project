# Retrieve-Project
I improved my engine by creating three new types of inverted index classes for assignment 3. These classes have extra features to make searches better.

For example, when searching in the article text, I added a special list that holds the length of each document. This helps calculate the Cosine Similarity Index, an important way to measure how close search results are to what's being looked for.

To speed up searches for document titles, I made a special list that has document IDs and titles together. This makes searching faster and helps show results quickly.

To keep things running smoothly, I put the files with lists of search results into different groups on Google Cloud Platform. And I did some common calculations, like the Cosine Similarity formula, outside of the main search functions. This way, the search function works well and finds things fast.

So, my changes help the search engine work better and get results quickly.
